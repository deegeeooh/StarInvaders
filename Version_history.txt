Star Invaders
=============

2D shooter prototype as part of the GameWeb.TV Unity 2D /C# course

Basic functionalities:

0.1_Alpha

- Using animated sprites (addition to the course, using multiple frame sprites as animations)
- Multiple scene game loop
- Enemy spawner which instantiates configurable waves of enemies with variable pathing
- Single and infinite loop posssibilities per wave (disabled in 0.3 too buggy) 
- Scrolling and looping background
- Particle effects for starfield background
- Particle effects for hits using sprite sheets
- Explosion animations 
- Damage GFX as child on impacted parent 
- audio clips for OnTrigger events
- Looped music per scene 

0.2_Alpha (03/08/2021)

- Added singleton 'GameSession' to track scores and stats  to be called across scenes
- Added Score display scripts for startscreen, levels and gameover screen
- Add player unvulnerability option
- Added CheckRemainingEnemies()  to check for level clearance (in player.cs)
- Single and autofire modes for player
- Enemy firing mode toward player 
- GUI elements for score and player info on all scenes

0.3_Alpha

- Added Singletons for musicplayer during levels
- Added Singleton for background scroller and effects
- Added delay per waveconfig and between loading scenes
- Added routine to create normalised vectors to player

[bugs]
- object reference not found during enemy spawn; this was due to Rigidbody2D's and Damage dealer missing components on enemies
- Dont add level when going to GameOver Screen
- Destroy player on GameOver Screen

[features]
- multiple projectile shooting: at player +  up, down, round + multiple projectiles
- added nested Loot table and loot item types:
	- gold (with value)
	- powerup
	- health
	- twin shot
	- triple shot
	
- random waves option for EnemySpawner 

0.4_alpha 9/8/2021

[bugs]
- corrected number of shots fired (double and triple laser wasnt't taken into account in Gamesession.cs
- added isDead bool to the health <= 0 check in Enemy.cs to prevent additional hits enter the lootroll method
- singleton for player projectiles
- corrected accuracy bonus calculation in Gameover canvas


[features]
- scaled dropitem sprites with: dropItem.transform.localScale = new Vector3(1.5f,1.5f ,1.5f);
- added configurable number of drops per roll per loottable | one or multiple
- maximized extra bullits on screen after powerup via extraBullitsOnScreen var in player
- normalzed enemy shooting before multiplying before acceleration in enemy.cs
		- now we can spawn projectiles evenly. one single method for all firing types : up/down/circle/toward player
- added joystick support
- added GoldPot to visualise accumulated gold 

[gameplay] (for testing purposes still only):
- added level 5 with multiple gold drops


0.5 alpha

[gameplay]
- added Random Pot game element, extra coin to drop not sure what to do with it yet

=============================
temp gameplay: LOOP the game
=============================
Hooks:
config:
{
- Levels.cs (current gamespeedfactor etc)
- gameSession 
	multipliers and bool yes/no gameloop
	Checks if level is completed (CheckIfLevelCompleted)// it was in player in Update but this caused problems when true; it spammed the Coroutines in Levels
		- Keeps track of number of spawners (Added and subtracted via EnemySpawners.cs
		- Keeps track of spawned enemies (via Enemy.cs kills, enemypathing.cs )
	gameloopsprite instantiation (as a child of gameSession so it will be destroyed with it

application of multipliers:
- backgroundScroller (scrollingspeed)
- Enemypathing.cs (enemy movement speed)
- Enemy.cs (shooting speed)
- gamesession (Add to Score)
- scoredisplay for gameloop multiplier text
}

[features]

Enemy Spawner:
	- added time between waves
	- added time before starting wave (added timeBeforeStart to waveconfig)
	- Added scalig with gameloop number of enemies
	- added min/max additional random enemies per wave
	- added rng of the spawn time
	
	added shredder all directions to kill off screen projectiles

- add placeholder introduction of enemies on start screen
- added Margy's new sprites as prefabs, Jellyyellow and JellyGreen
- added rotation routine for the Enemy projectiles
- added keys to disable music/invulnarability/skip level in gameSession()


[bugs]
- found bug that increased the level; it was the random routine in enemy spawner 
			currentWave = waveConfigs[Random.Range(0, waveConfigs.Count) -1 ]; the -1 one was removed


TODO // Ideas
====
features:

Splash screen
credits screen
attract screen	

bonus stage > hit all enemies, gold run
levelup inbetween screens

different background per X levels

Ideas: bonus levels 
The coins you find can be spent to acquire new levels, enemytypes, enemy density, upgrades in between X levels in
a kinda shop where you fly over things.

Boss levels
Bosses

make the spawning of waves completely scriptable
