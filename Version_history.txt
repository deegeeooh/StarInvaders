- Added Singletons for musicplayer during levels
- Added Singleton for background scroller and effects

[bugs]
- corrected number of shots fired (double and triple laser wasnt't taken into account in Gamesession.cs
- added isDead bool to the health <= 0 check in Enemy.cs to prevent additional hits enter the lootroll method

[features]
- scaled dropitem sprites with: dropItem.transform.localScale = new Vector3(1.5f,1.5f ,1.5f);
- added configurable number of drops per roll per loottable | one or multiple
- maximized extra bullits on screen after powerup via extraBullitsOnScreen var in player
- normalzed enemy shooting before multiplying before acceleration in enemy.cs
		- now we can spawn projectiles evenly. one single method for all firing types : up/down/circle/toward player
