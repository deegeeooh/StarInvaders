Starinvaders is inpired on the classic hardcore vertical arcade shoot'em-ups 
from the 80's with the main goal revolving around getting the highest score possible.

This prototype is developed as part of the GameDev.TV 2D Unity/C# course, 
with several additions.

For a list of changes, see versionhistory.txt

The game currently features:

- Gameloop with increasing difficulty
- Gamepad support
- Configurable loottables with dropchances per item 
- Some animated pixelstyle sprites
- Gameloop with (simple) configurable and randomizable increase in difficulty
- custom drop randomizer 
- highscore saving
- several upgrades

The game runs in classic arcade 4:3 aspect ratio in 1024x768 resolion in a window (Alt-Enter to switch fullscreen)

Installation (Windows desktop build)
====================================

Download and unzip the binary from the latest release, start with Starinvaders.exe

Todo:

- Splashscreen
- Bosses
- actual gameplay balancing (interesting patterns etc) (prototype has been focused on
- the functionality of the gameobjects and systems so far, but is playable (pretty hardcore tho)
- additional pattern and movement variations
- additional and balanced upgrades 

(to be implemented when I revisit this after learning more C#)
